It's a common requirement that asks for an element to be shown absolutely to a particular element. We can list some cases, such as

* Show a popover when clicking an element
* Show a tooltip when moving the mouse over an element
* Or show a context menu when right-clicking an element 

In this post, you'll see three ways to archive that requirement. They are implemented to demonstrate the first use case where we display a popover under a given target.

First of all, assume that the target and popover elements are two simple `div` elements as below:

```html
<div id="target">...</div>
<div id="popover">...</div>
```

{% callout %}
### Resource

The implementations don't tell you how to add an arrow to the popover. You can take a look at this [page](https://csslayout.io/patterns/popover-arrow/) to see how it can be done with CSS.

## 1. Use absolute CSS

This is the easiest way. To position the popover absolutely to the target, we can place the popover in the target

```html
<div id="target" class="target">
    ...
    <div id="popover" class="popover">
        ...
    </div>
</div>
```

and apply the simple CSS styles as below:

```css
.target {
    position: relative;
}
.popover {
    left: 50%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 100%;
    transform: translate(-50%, .75rem);
}
```

This way uses CSS only and doesn't require any position calculation. Anyway, it doesn't work if the target has the `overflow: hidden` style.

In the demo below, clicking the _Toggle overflow:hidden_ button will make the popover hidden as well.

## 2. Append the popover to `body`

This approach comes from the idea of putting the popover to `body`:

```html
<body>
    <div id="target">...</div>

    <div id="popover">...</div>
</body>
```

We still use the absolute style for the popover, but this time we need to calculate the `top` and `left` properties.

It's easy to determine them based on the bounding rectangles of the target and popover:

```js
const target = document.getElementById('target');
const popover = document.getElementById('popover');

const targetRect = target.getBoundingClientRect();
const popoverRect = popover.getBoundingClientRect();

const top = targetRect.top + targetRect.height;
const left = targetRect.left + targetRect.width / 2 - popoverRect.width / 2;
```

We also need space for the arrow at the top, so let's add some offset:

```js
popover.style.top = `${top + 8}px`;
popover.style.left = `${left}px`;
```

<iframe src='/demo/position-an-element-absolutely-to-another-element/absolute.html'></iframe>

## 3. Use an anchor element

This approach is similar to the previous one. The difference is that instead of appending the popover to `body`, we add an anchor between the target and popover.

```html
<div id="target">...</div>
<div id="anchor" class="anchor"></div>
<div id="popover">...</div>
```

The anchor is positioned absolutely as following:

```css
.anchor {
    left: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
}
```

The popover's top and left properties have to subtract the top and left values of the anchor from the one we calculate in the previous section:

```js
const target = document.getElementById('target');
const anchor = document.getElementById('anchor');
const popover = document.getElementById('popover');

const targetRect = target.getBoundingClientRect();
const anchorRect = anchor.getBoundingClientRect();
const popoverRect = popover.getBoundingClientRect();

const top = targetRect.top + targetRect.height;
const left = targetRect.left + targetRect.width / 2 - popoverRect.width / 2;

popover.style.top = `${top - anchorRect.top + 8}px`;
popover.style.left = `${left - anchorRect.left}px`;
```

Allowing users to copy sample code is a common thing in the web development nowadays.
To demonstrate the implementation, we create two elements:

```html
<pre id="sampleCode"><code>...</code></pre>
<button id="copyButton">Copy</button>
```

The `sampleCode` element contains the sample code which is already highlighted.

Copying the sample code to the clipboard could consist of three steps:

* [Select](/select-the-text-content-of-an-element) the text content of the code element
* [Copy](/copy-text-to-the-clipboard) it to the clipboard using the `document.execCommand('copy')` function
* Last but not least, both the steps above have an effect on the text selection.

So we have to backup the current selected text before copying, and [restore it](/save-and-restore-the-text-selection) at the end.

You can see the code in the demo below. Enjoy!

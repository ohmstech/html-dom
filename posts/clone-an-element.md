```js
const cloned = ele.cloneNode(true);
```

Using the `cloneNode(true)` method will deep copy a given element. In the sample code above, all attributes and children of the original node `ele` will be cloned in `cloned` as well.

Passing `false` produces a cloned node that keeps only the attributes and the original node:

```js
const cloned = ele.cloneNode(false);
```
